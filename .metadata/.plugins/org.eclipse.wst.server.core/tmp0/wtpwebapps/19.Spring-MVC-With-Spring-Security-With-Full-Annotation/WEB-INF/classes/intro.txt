Spring Security's CSRF Protection:-> 
-> CSRF protection is enabled by default in spring security.
-> spring security uses the synchronizer token pattern
  -> each request includes a session cookie and randomly generated token
 -> for request processing, spring security verifies token before processing
 -> All of this is handled by spring security filters.
 
 -> for form submissions use POST instead of get
 -> include csrf token in form submission
 -> <form:form> auto magically adds csrf token
 -> if you don't use <form:form>,you must manually add csrf token
 
 <form>
 	<input type="hidden" 
 	    name="${_csrf.parameterName}"
 	    value="${_csrf.token}"/>
 </form>
 
 spring mvc form tag is preferred
