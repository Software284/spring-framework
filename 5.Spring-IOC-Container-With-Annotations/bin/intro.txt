What are Java Annotations?
->Special labels/marksers added to java classes
->Provide meta-data about the class
-> Processed at compile time or run-time for special
processing.

Why Spring Configuration with Annotations:->
-> XML configuration can be verbose
-> Configure your spring beans with Annotations
-> Annotations minimizes the XML configurations.

Scanning for Component Classes:->
-> spring will scan your java classes for special annotations
-> automatically register the beans in the spring container
