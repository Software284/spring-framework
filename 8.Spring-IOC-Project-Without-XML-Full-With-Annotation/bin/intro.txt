3 Ways of configuring Spring Container
i. Full XML Configuration
ii. XML Component Scan
iii. Java Configuration Class

Difference Between Bean and Component:->
Auto detection:->
It is used to explicitly declare a single bean, rather than letting Spring do it automatically. 
If any class is annotated with @Component it will be automatically detect by using classpath scan.

Spring Container:->
Bean can be created even class is outside the spring container
We can’t create bean if class is outside spring container

Class/Method  Level Annotation:->
It is a method level annotation
It is a class level annotation

@Configuration:->
It works only when class is also annotated with @Configuration
It works without @Configuration annotation

Use Case:->
We should use @bean, if you want specific implementation based on dynamic condition.
We can’t write specific implementation based on dynamic condition
